For this project, I added three grey cubes to the right of the characters that will animate upon the player getting close to them. 

The UI start screen buttons seemed to have some trouble in the build. It worked perfectly in the Unity editor, and after building the start & exit button stopped being clickable. I could not find a solution for this. Unfortunately, this may make the build unusable to grade. If you understand what the issue is, I would very much appreciate comments on how to fix the issue.
